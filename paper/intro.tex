The Fast Fourier Transform is one of the most important numerical algorithms of our time. First discovered by Gauss in 1805, and later rediscovered by Cooley and Tukey in 1965, the fast fourier transform allows us to compute the discrete fourier transform of a set of points in $O(Nlog(N))$ time instead of $O(N^2)$ time, as the naive algorithm would do. Various different fast fourier transform algorithms have since been discovered, and the fast fourier transform has been used in all kinds of applications, from signal processing to data compression.
